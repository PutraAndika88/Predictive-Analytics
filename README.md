XYZ Company in 2024 wants to release its new flagship product to the Indonesian smartphone market after seeing market conditions where customers still need smartphone product references for their choices. XYZ Company plans to release a smartphone variant by emphasizing specifications on greater battery power with wider storage. In addition, the company also wants to optimize the camera feature to be able to compete with the trend of smartphone cameras that are currently circulating in the market.

This predictive analysis is done with 1000+ smartphone data in the Indonesian market.
